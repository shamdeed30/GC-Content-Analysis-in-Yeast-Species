- This repository contains python pipelines for GC/GC3 content analysis with a sliding window approach.
- Pipelines include various yeast species – there are slight changes in pre-processings of the data files based on the species being analyzed.
- Some of the analyses and visualizations are not done in all of the pipelines, so taking a quick glimplse through each file is highly encouraged.

*** Moderate understanding of Python and Statistics is necessary to fully grasp the algorithms and analyses. However, I am currently working on creating an elaborate documentation that explains the algorithms, reasoning, and findings. The documentation would be published by mid-summer of 2025.
